<h3 id="exercise-1-manage-agile-project">Exercise 1: Manage Agile project</h3>

<p>In this exercise, you will use Azure Boards to perform a number of common agile planning and portfolio management tasks, including management of teams, areas, iterations, work items, sprints and capacity, customizing Kanban boards, defining dashboards, and customizing team processes.</p>

<h4 id="task-1-manage-teams-areas-and-iterations">Task 1: Manage teams, areas, and iterations</h4>

<p>In this task, you will create a new team and configure its area and iterations.</p>

<p>Each new project is configured with a default team, which name matches the project name. You have the option of creating additional teams. Each team can be granted access to a suite of Agile tools and team assets. The ability to create multiple teams gives you the flexibility to choose the proper balance between autonomy and collaboration across the enterprise.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Verify that the web browser displays your Azure DevOps organization with the <strong>Agile Planning and Portfolio Management with Azure Boards</strong> project you generated in the previous exercise.</p>

    <blockquote>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the list of <strong>Teams</strong>, select the newly created team to view its details.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Note</strong>: By default, the new team has only you as its member. You can use this view to manage such functionality as team membership, notifications, and dashboards.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>Iterations and Area Paths</strong> link at the top of the <strong>PUL-Web</strong> page to start defining the schedule and scope of the team.</p>

    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Repeat the previous step to add <strong>Sprint 2</strong> and <strong>Sprint 3</strong>. The second sprint is our current iteration, and the third is in the near future.</p>

    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="task-2-manage-work-items">Task 2: Manage work items</h4>

<p>In this task, you will step through common work item management tasks.</p>

<p>Work items play a prominent role in Azure DevOps. Whether describing work to be done, impediments to release, test definitions, or other key items, work items are the workhorse of modern projects. In this task you’ll focus on using various work items to set up the plan to extend the Parts Unlimited site with a product training section. While it can be daunting to build out such a substantial part of a company’s offering, Azure DevOps and the Scrum process make it very manageable.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: This task is designed to illustrate a variety of ways you can create different kinds of work items, as well as to demonstrate the breadth of features available on the platform. As a result, these steps should not be viewed as prescriptive guidance for project management. The features are intended to be flexible enough to fit your process needs, so explore and experiment as you go.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="task-3-manage-sprints-and-capacity">Task 3: Manage sprints and capacity</h4>

<p>In this task, you will step through common sprint and capacity management tasks.</p>

<p>Teams build the sprint backlog during the sprint planning meeting, typically held on the first day of the sprint. Each sprint corresponds to a time-boxed interval which supports the team’s ability to work using Agile processes and tools. During the planning meeting, the product owner works with the team to identify those stories or backlog items to complete in the sprint.</p>

<p>Planning meetings typically consist of two parts. In the first part, the team and product owner identify the backlog items that the team feels it can commit to completing in the sprint, based on experience with previous sprints. These items get added to the sprint backlog. In the second part, the team determines how it will develop and test each item. They then define and estimate the tasks required to complete each item. Finally, the team commits to implementing some or all the items based on these estimates.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Note</strong>: One convenient feature of the boards is that you can easily update key data in-line. It’s a good practice to regularly update the <strong>Remaining Work</strong> estimate to reflect the amount of time expected for each task.

      <p><strong>Note</strong>: This automatically expands the <strong>Development</strong> and your personal capacities to their maximum. Since they’re large enough to cover the assigned tasks, they stay green.

    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Note</strong>: One way to resolve this capacity issue would be to move the task to a future iteration. There are a few ways this could be done. You could, for example, open the task here and edit it within the panel providing access to the task details. Another approach would be to use the <strong>Backlog</strong> view, which provides an in-line menu option to move it. At this point though, don’t move the task yet.</p>

<h4 id="task-4-customize-kanban-boards">Task 4: Customize Kanban boards</h4>

<p>In this task, you will step through the process of customizing Kanban boards.</p>

<p>To maximize a team’s ability to consistently deliver high quality software, Kanban emphasizes two main practices. The first, visualizing the flow of work, requires that you map your team’s workflow stages and configure a Kanban board to match. The second, constraining the amount of work in progress, requires that you set work-in-progress (WIP) limits. You’re then ready to track progress on your Kanban board and monitor key metrics to reduce lead or cycle time. Your Kanban board turns your backlog into an interactive signboard, providing a visual flow of work. As work progresses from idea to completion, you update the items on the board. Each column represents a work stage, and each card represents a user story (blue cards) or a bug (red cards) at that stage of work. However, every team develops its own process over time, so the ability to customize the Kanban board to match the way your team works is critical for the successful delivery.</p>

<h4 id="task-5-customize-team-process">Task 5: Customize team process</h4>

<p>In this task we’ll create a custom Scrum-based process. The process will include a backlog item field designed to track to a proprietary PartsUnlimited ticket ID.</p>

<p>In Azure DevOps, you customize your work tracking experience through a process. A process defines the building blocks of the work item tracking system as well as other sub-systems you access through Azure DevOps. Whenever you create a team project, you select the process which contains the building blocks you want for your project. Azure DevOps supports two process types. The first, the core system processes (Scrum, Agile, and CMMI) are read-only, so you cannot customize them. The second type, inherited processes, you create based on core system processes, with the option of customizing their settings.</p>

<p>All processes are shared within the same organization. That is, one or more team projects can reference a single process. Instead of customizing a single team project, you customize a process. Changes made to the process automatically update all team projects that reference that process. Once you’ve created an inherited process, you can customize it, create team projects based on it, and migrate existing team projects to reference it. The Git team project can’t be customized until it’s migrated to an inherited process.</p>

Each tile corresponds to a widget that provides access to one or more features or functions.</p>
