                <p><strong>Why learn this</strong>? Clienteling is an important element in Retail World. Many
retailers, especially high-end specialty retailers, want their sales associates
to form long-term relationships with their key customers. The associates are
expected to know about these customers’ likes and dislikes, purchase history,
product preferences, and important dates, such as anniversaries and birthdays.
Associates need a place where they can capture this information and easily find
it when it’s required. If this information is available in a single view, the
associates can easily target customers who meet specific criteria. For example,
they can find all customers who prefer to shop for handbags, or customers who
have an important event approaching, such as a birthday or anniversary.</p>

<p>• Benefits of Clienteling in retail businesses.</p>

about the company’s products and services, and the company does not know much
about the customer base. The company wants to learn more about their customers
and help associates form long-term relationships with key customers.</p>
